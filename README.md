## What is Lean?

Lean is an interactive theorem prover and functional programming language
used to write machine-checked mathematical proofs and formally verified programs.

Lean is widely used in:
- Formalized mathematics
- Logic and foundations of math
- Programming language theory
- Verified software and proof-carrying code

This repository contains formal proofs written in Lean as part of the
Set Theory Game, an interactive introduction to reasoning about sets,
logic, and proofs inside Lean.

The proofs here are what I thought of while solving the problems, so they may not be the most concise or direct ones.
